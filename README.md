# crudApi4

This is bones for expenses app for shopping. 
It talks to Firebase Firestore in project drake.ber@gmail.com   crudApi3 . 
It shares project with rudApi3-product which has a table in the database. 
That is just archival code as it took me 2 days to get running. 

based on this video tutorial:

**You need to be in the functions directory to run **
**>npm run serve**

_Once that is up and running you can use postman._


~~I need to reconfigure collection items in database in a new table.~~ 
Then I need an interface for a mobile app 
Then hopefully a static site with cloud functions taking/bringing data from the database. 
Ineed to deploy functions
I need to make a webapp
I need to make fields/html to put all the code in
(would be nice to have lists but that will be for later)
